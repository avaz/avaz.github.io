## Summary

I work in the software development segment for more than 15 years, based on projects that I got implanted I've acquired huge and solid knowledge in developing, building and architecture software.

I have practical experience and conceptual knowledge of good development practices like refactoring, testing, create readable and clean code. I know that short development iterations and a closer stakeholder always ensures much of the success of a software project.
