=== Gelre Trabalhos Temporários
.Senior Java System Analyst, March 2003 - December 2005 (2 years 10 months), São Paulo Area, Brazil

This company I had a great experience on how team work can make things happen. I worked together with other 20 people to implement a in house ERP system for the 3 companies of the Gelre group. We discussed and tested different approaches for software development, test, quality assurance, deploy, etc.
