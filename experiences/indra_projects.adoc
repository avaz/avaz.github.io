*Description:* A platform to integrate multiple point of sale systems to into one to handle all the logistic matters. The platform handled the creation of an order until its delivery. When I joined this project was in a bad shape with no good management, implemention or process in place. I managed and led a team of 8 people to rebuilt this platform being responsible for the overall architecture, scalability and performance goals. Also I deployed an agile way of work and good practices which levarage use of better software development tools like Git and Maven. Enforced a Test Driven Development and coach the team understand and apply those methodologies.
