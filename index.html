<p>Notable recent professional experiences are LiDL Germany where worked in build a machine learning pipeline to training models with 1TB+ of information weekly. Models were used to predict quantity pastry articles required to bake for the 3 baking batches for LiDL stores all around the world. This led to savings in waste up to €4mi annually. For European Union ENISA division created artificial intelligence enabled Cyber Security Awareness Machine. This system index cyber security information from different sources and apply NLP and Knowledge Graph techniques to enable query the information in a more human friendly way. Allowing the user to full text search the gathered information and create awareness report to spread throughout European Union.</p>

We apply NLP technology on all our data to ensure that it’s clean, reliable and ready for Machine Learning Translation and for that we have a robust data pipeline made of several components that ensure the high quality of our data. Also on our business pipeline is planned expansion our data offering for other kinds like annotated data, sounds, voices and more. At TAUS <strong>I’m in charge of the whole engineering and data teams</strong>, I oversee everything that is created and align our technologies with the business goals but that this really means is that I’m one of actual doers, I don’t just communicate and explain the need but I also design and help to shape how it will look like technically speaking, a very hands on position and attitude.
