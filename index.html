<div class="title">Summary</div>
<p>C-Level professional with over 15 years of experience, possessing a solid technical background complemented by robust business management skills. I have worked across various industries, undertaking a diverse range of roles from functional and managerial to executive. I hold a Major in Computer Science, a Master&#8217;s in Business Administration with a specialization in Enterprise Management, and a comprehensive set of industry technology certifications and specializations. I have proven experience in building high-performance agile teams, defining lean business processes, and strategic thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, I hold the Chief Technology Officer position at TAUS,
having previously served as Principal Software Engineer.
At TAUS,
I led the company&#8217;s data and digital transformation
by creating a Data Architecture to support over 1TB of TAUS and Customer Language Data,
with a focus on serverless technology.
I helped to deploy a software architecture which would favor simplicity and <em>boring</em> tools and technologies in the company&#8217;s IT infrastructure
to allow increasing business domain scalability in a controlled manner.
TAUS is a small company, but we deliver more than what is expected from a company of our size.
I defined several business processes to decrease company operational costs and promoted a culture of knowledge sharing,
which allowed the company to interchange people across projects and needs,
thus increasing the IT operation range without the need to hire additional personnel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I led the digital transformation project, which completely revamped TAUS&#8217;s service and website technologies,
enabling the company to publish content faster than ever before.
I continuously define the right set of services and technologies for IT to use to align with business goals,
keeping the company competitive and teams up-to-date with what matters.
I also assist in mentoring team members in new technologies through workshops and PoCs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last but not least, I&#8217;m actively engaged in help to shape and define business,
I have a strong entrepreneurial mindset.
I see technology as a tool to achieve business goals and business goals
should always be well-defined; otherwise, no technology will fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some past notable experiences are with LiDL Germany, where I contributed to building a machine learning pipeline that trained models with over 1TB of information weekly. These models were utilized to predict the quantity of pastry articles required for the three baking batches at LiDL stores worldwide. This initiative led to a significant reduction in waste, saving up to €4 million annually. Additionally, for the European Union ENISA division, I created an artificial intelligence-enabled Cyber Security Awareness Machine. This system indexed cyber-security information from various sources and applied NLP and Knowledge Graph techniques to enable more human-friendly information querying. It allowed users to perform full-text searches of the gathered information and create awareness reports for distribution throughout the European Union.</p>

<div class="title">Chief Technology Officer, March 2020 - Present, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</div>
<p>At TAUS, I’m in charge of the whole engineering and data teams, I oversee everything that is created and align our technologies with the business goals. But what this really means is that I’m one of the actual doers, I don’t just communicate and explain the need but I also design and help to shape how it will look like technically speaking, a very hands-on position and attitude. I’m responsible for designing and implementing most of our core Data Architecture entirely based on serverless pipelines. I’m the head of a multidisciplinary and multipolyglot teams made of back and front enders and NLP research and analysts, working in different fronts that come together delivering production-ready products.
Initially,
I started as Principal Software Engineer with the responsibility to create realize the Data Marketplace project,
an EU funded project.
Soon after delivering this project, I engaged in creating what is now the main data architecture in the company.
With that I moved as Head of Data Engineering and later as Head of Engineering
where I assembled teams to deliver all sorts of projects, including a complete digital transformation by deploying a set a new tools and processes, and recently the creation of a new product for the translation industry, TAUS Quality Estimate API. Some of these projects I helped to design and implement myself, others I led the team that did it, and others I was the one that made sure that the project was delivered on time and with the expected quality.</p>

<p>An e-commerce platform to allow selling and buying Language Data (i.e., translations).
The platform allows the user to upload a file with the data to be sold,
define the price and additional metadata like domain and content-type.
The platform also allows the user to buy data from other users.
The platform is integrated with a payment gateway
to allow the user to pay for the data and be paid when their data is sold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Attributions:</div>
<p>I was hired to create the platform from scratch.
I developed it in a window of 5 months together with another developer.
Out of this project was created the Data Language Architecture which currently is the main data architecture for the company.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A platform to allow ingestion, processing, and cleaning of Language Data (i.e., translations).
The set of components that compose the platform comprises the core of the company&#8217;s data architecture.
Giving the nature of the data ingestion at TAUS was decided to take a serveless approach to the architecture.
A file is uploaded to S3
and a Lambda function is triggered which in turn check if up to certain threshold ECS tasks are running,
if it is the lambda just forward the file information to a SQS queue which will be processed by the ECS task, if not the lambda will start a new ECS task to process the file and forward the message to the SQS queue.
This is because files tend to be big and a strict clean process is needed to be applied to the data,
which takes time and would exceed the 15-minutes limit of a lambda function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Attributions:</div>
<p>I implemented the whole architecture from scratch
providing at the end a standard way to do data ingestion and an API to consume the data ingested.</p>

<p>The situation was the following, <a href="https://www.taus.net" class="bare">https://www.taus.net</a>;
the main company website was hosted by Joomla, an exceptional CMS platform.
However, there was only one person in the company maintaining it and the person was not so happy.
All the other engineers were working with Java and modern NodeJS frameworks.
This wasn&#8217;t interesting to anybody involved in this situation.
After a thoughtful analysis, I made a plan,
assembled a team of four people, two juniors, one senior, and I,
and we moved on to create a new website with a new technology stack.
The senior engineer was responsible for the backend,
which included migrating user base from Joomla to a new database
and also provides an API for authentication and corporate data.
The juniors were responsible for the frontend and integrate with the new chosen CMS.
In 2 development cycles (12 weeks) we were up and running with the website
that is live to this day (<a href="https://www.taus.net" class="bare">https://www.taus.net</a>),
with support for product checkout integrated with several payment brokers.
Giving the component-based approach taken to build the website, currently,
business people can create new pages and components without the need for a developer in a fully decoupled way.
The two juniors at the beginning of the project were operating like mid-seniors by the end.
A lot of knowledge was transferred, and the team was able to deliver the project on time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Attributions:</div>
<p>I helped to define the base architecture, defined the technology stack,
and more importantly, mentored the team to deliver the project.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the latest development at TAUS which I&#8217;m deeply involved.
NLP team at TAUS found a way to measure the quality of translations done by machine engines like Google Translator,
DeepL, etc. The idea is to provide a score between 0.0 and 1.0 to a translation base on several factors.
This led to us to create a public API to allow users to send a translation and get a score back,
thus automate localization processes which currently is our main service being used by several users processing millions of translations per month.</p>
