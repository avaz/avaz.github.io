Proven experience in build high performance agile teams and define lean business processes and strategic thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notable recent professional experiences are LiDL Germany where worked in build a machine learning pipeline to training models with 1TB+ of information weekly. Models were used to predict quantity pastry articles required to bake for the 3 baking batches for LiDL stores all around the world. This led to savings in waste up to €4mi annually. For European Union ENISA division created artificial intelligence enabled Cyber Security Awareness Machine. This system index cyber security information from different sources and apply NLP and Knowledge Graph techniques to enable query the information in a more human friendly way. Allowing the user to full text search the gathered information and create awareness report to spread throughout European Union.</p>

<p>At TAUS, a data company where the main asset is translation data, we have over 35 billion words in several languages and we have platforms that enable translators to produce translation data - <a href="https://hlp.taus.net" class="bare">https://hlp.taus.net</a> - or sell the translation data - <a href="https://datamarketplace.taus.net" class="bare">https://datamarketplace.taus.net</a> - they own. We apply NLP technology on all our data to ensure that it’s clean, reliable and ready for Machine Learning Translation and for that we have a robust data pipeline made of several components that ensure the high quality of our data. Also on our business pipeline is planned expansion our data offering for other kinds like annotated data, sounds, voices and more. At TAUS <strong>I’m in charge of the whole engineering and data teams</strong>, I oversee everything that is created and align our technologies with the business goals but that this really means is that I’m one of actual doers, I don’t just communicate and explain the need but I also design and help to shape how it will look like technically speaking, a very hands on position and attitude. I&#8217;m responsible design and implement most of our core Data Architecture entirely based on server less pipelines. I&#8217;m the head of a multidisciplinary and multipolyglot teams made of back and front enders and NLP research and analysts, working in different fronts that come together develivering production-ready products.</p>

<p>A platform to allow ingestion, processing and streamline paper forms such as tax submissions, mortgages, loans, etc. The platform receives the scanned document, recognise its  the type through machine learning image recognition models, split it apart in different sub images, apply OCR to gather the text and by use other machine learning models it identifies things like ticked check boxes, afterwards with all the information captured send it to the proper Bank system for further processing.
This project led to a huge savings in money and time for the Bank by a significant decrease in manual and error-prone processing.</p>

<p>I was responsible for create what was called as a 'Model Management Framework' component whose goal was to create a functional abstraction layer between the data scientists and the whole automated infrastructure. The MMF orchestrated all the steps needed to create a machine model such as testing, training, deploy and releasing. Applying strategies as 'Champion/Challenger' with multi model deployment. Together with the framework a business user interface was created for the data scientist trigger training, deployments and releases for the models managed by the framework.</p>
