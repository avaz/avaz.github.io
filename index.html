</li>
<li>
<p>Revamped the TAUS website (<a href="https://taus.net" class="bare">https://taus.net</a>), replaced Joomla with using Nuxt.js v3, Tailwind CSS, and Storyblok CMS. Joomla is great and a nice CMS but we had just one person in the company who knew how to work with it, with the revamp we have a much more flexible and modern website that is straightforward to maintain and update by anyone in the company. The website is deployed on AWS ECS using Docker and GitHub Actions. This application also integrates with other microservices for authentication and authorization and user management.</p>

<li>
<p>A serverless Data architecture for data processing and analytics. The architecture is built using Spring Camel, Apache Camel, QueryDSL/SQL, AWS Lambda/S3/Aurora/SNS/SQS/ECS, to AWS ECS using GitHub Actions. The data processing starts by uploading a file to S3 which triggers a lambda function that checks if there is enough AWS ECS Tasks available (rate limiting) to process the file, if not it triggers a new task otherwise forwards the message to a SQS queue which later will be consumed by the task. The task once completed sends a notifications to SNS where other components (ECS Tasks) will consume the message and process the data. Errors are sent to a SQS DLQ for further investigation.</p>

<div class="title">Head of Data and Engineering, March 2020 - Present, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</div>
<p>At TAUS, I’m in charge of the whole engineering and data teams, I oversee everything that is created and align our technologies with the business goals. But what this really means is that I’m one of the actual doers, I don’t just communicate and explain the need but I also design and help to shape how it will look like technically speaking, a very hands-on position and attitude. I’m responsible for designing and implementing most of our core Data Architecture entirely based on serverless pipelines. I’m the head of a multidisciplinary and multipolyglot teams made of back and front enders and NLP research and analysts, working in different fronts that come together delivering production-ready products.
Initially,
I started as Principal Software Engineer with the responsibility to create realize the Data Marketplace project,
an EU funded project.
Soon after delivering this project, I engaged in creating what is now the main data architecture in the company.
With that I moved as Head of Data Engineering and later as Head of Engineering
where I assembled teams to deliver all sorts of projects, including a complete digital transformation by deploying a set a new tools and processes, and recently the creation of a new product for the translation industry, TAUS Quality Estimate API. Some of these projects I helped to design and implement myself, others I led the team that did it, and others I was the one that made sure that the project was delivered on time and with the expected quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_projects">Projects</h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_quality_estimate_api">Quality Estimate API</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Designed Machine Learning operations workflow
where machine learning engineers can training models using GPUs or CPUs in a cost-effective manner
using tools that favours serverless and affordable infrastructure machine instances,
with support for job save and resuming and knowledge sharing among the team members.
This greatly improves our Machine Learning/NLP researching projects and operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Architected and implemented TAUS Quality Estimate API which process 50mi+ characters daily.
The solution offers metrics scoring that evaluates how good is a machine translation.
This is the company&#8217;s flagship product
with used by big tech customers in ride-sharing and transportation network industry,
fraud prevention services, LSP&#8217;s and others.
It&#8217;s a HTTP API with a MLOps workflow, developed using Python, PyTorch, Poetry, AWS EC2+GPU.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Attributions:</div>
<p>I was responsible for the whole development of the API from scratch, excluding the Machine Learning model training.
However, I implemented the whole model management process and the API to serve the model.</p>

<p>An e-commerce platform to allow selling and buying Language Data (i.e., translations).
The platform allows the user to upload a file with the data to be sold,
define the price and additional metadata like domain and content-type.
The platform also allows the user to buy data from other users.
The platform is integrated with a payment gateway
to allow the user to pay for the data and be paid when their data is sold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Attributions:</div>
<p>I was hired to create the platform from scratch.
I developed it in a window of 5 months together with another developer.
Out of this project was created the Data Language Architecture which currently is the main data architecture for the company.</p>

<h5 id="_data_language_architecture">Data Language Architecture</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A platform to allow ingestion, processing, and cleaning of Language Data (i.e., translations).
The set of components that compose the platform comprises the core of the company&#8217;s data architecture.
Giving the nature of the data ingestion at TAUS was decided to take a serveless approach to the architecture.
A file is uploaded to S3
and a Lambda function is triggered which in turn check if up to certain threshold ECS tasks are running,
if it is the lambda just forward the file information to a SQS queue which will be processed by the ECS task, if not the lambda will start a new ECS task to process the file and forward the message to the SQS queue.
This is because files tend to be big and a strict clean process is needed to be applied to the data,
which takes time and would exceed the 15-minutes limit of a lambda function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Attributions:</div>
<p>I implemented the whole architecture from scratch
providing at the end a standard way to do data ingestion and an API to consume the data ingested.</p>

<h5 id="_digital_transformation">Digital Transformation</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The situation was the following, <a href="https://www.taus.net" class="bare">https://www.taus.net</a>;
the main company website was hosted by Joomla, an exceptional CMS platform.
However, there was only one person in the company maintaining it and the person was not so happy.
All the other engineers were working with Java and modern NodeJS frameworks.
This wasn&#8217;t interesting to anybody involved in this situation.
After a thoughtful analysis, I made a plan,
assembled a team of four people, two juniors, one senior, and I,
and we moved on to create a new website with a new technology stack.
The senior engineer was responsible for the backend,
which included migrating user base from Joomla to a new database
and also provides an API for authentication and corporate data.
The juniors were responsible for the frontend and integrate with the new chosen CMS.
In 2 development cycles (12 weeks) we were up and running with the website
that is live to this day (<a href="https://www.taus.net" class="bare">https://www.taus.net</a>),
with support for product checkout integrated with several payment brokers.
Giving the component-based approach taken to build the website, currently,
business people can create new pages and components without the need for a developer in a fully decoupled way.
The two juniors at the beginning of the project were operating like mid-seniors by the end.
A lot of knowledge was transferred, and the team was able to deliver the project on time.</p>
