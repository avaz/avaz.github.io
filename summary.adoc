a|.Summary
C-Level professional with over 15 years of experience, possessing a solid technical background complemented by robust business management skills. I have worked across various industries, undertaking a diverse range of roles from functional and managerial to executive. I hold a Major in Computer Science, a Master's in Business Administration with a specialization in Enterprise Management, and a comprehensive set of industry technology certifications and specializations. I have proven experience in building high-performance agile teams, defining lean business processes, and strategic thinking.

Notably, I have worked with LiDL Germany, where I contributed to building a machine learning pipeline that trained models with over 1TB of information weekly. These models were utilized to predict the quantity of pastry articles required for the three baking batches at LiDL stores worldwide. This initiative led to a significant reduction in waste, saving up to â‚¬4 million annually. Additionally, for the European Union ENISA division, I created an artificial intelligence-enabled Cyber Security Awareness Machine. This system indexed cyber security information from various sources and applied NLP and Knowledge Graph techniques to enable more human-friendly information querying. It allowed users to perform full-text searches of the gathered information and create awareness reports for distribution throughout the European Union.

Currently, I hold the position of Chief Technology Officer at TAUS, having previously served as Principal Software Engineer. At TAUS, I led the company's data and digital transformation by creating a Data Architecture to support over 1TB of TAUS and Customer Language Data, with a focus on serverless technology. I deployed a microservices architecture within the company's IT infrastructure to increase business domain scalability in a controlled manner. I defined several business processes to decrease company operational costs and promoted a culture of knowledge sharing, which allowed the company to interchange people across projects and needs, thus increasing the IT operation range without the need to hire additional personnel. I led the digital transformation project, which completely revamped TAUS's service and website technologies, enabling the company to digitize faster than ever before. I continuously define the right set of services and technologies for IT to use to align with business goals, keeping the company competitive and teams up-to-date with what matters. I also assist in mentoring team members in new technologies through workshops and PoCs.
