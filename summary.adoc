a|.Summary

I work in the software development segment for more than 15 years and 6+ years professional projects and teams management, based on projects that I got implanted I've acquired huge and solid knowledge in developing, building and architecture software. In most of these years I worked with Java Platform based systems, so I have secured knowledge in Java but also in plenty others programming languages as Ruby, Python, Javascript.

I have practical experience and conceptual knowledge of good development practices like refactoring, testing, create readable and clean code. I know that short development iterations and a closer stakeholder always ensures much of the success of a software project.

Besides I know many of frameworks I always try to solve the problems based on a good algorithm where a minimum framework use will be necessary, by this way always the solution will be more simple and easy to manage.

//From monolith to micro services, from SOA to ReST (and GraphQL), from native to virtualised to containers, from structured data to unstructured data together with their databases. I try to keep my self up to date with industries standards and good practices while keeping an eye on what's coming next.

*Techs don't solve problems, people do.*

a|.Some of my key skills:

* A passion for cutting-edge Software Technologies
* Comfortable in programming in Java (main language), Python, Ruby, Java(ECMA)script, by comfortable means knowledge in the language syntax and semantics as its ecosystem of tools, libraries and best practices.
* Very strong experience with TDD/BDD.
* Know very well CI/CD and the use of tools like Git/SNV, Source Respository Github/lab/bitbucket, Maven/Gradle, Nexus/Bamboo, Ansible, VM/Containers.
* Very strong communication skills and strong mentorship skills.
* Very strong knowledge in data processing, ingestion and wrangling and technologies for structured and unstructured data like SQL and NOSQL databases, BigData/Hadoop, Streaming Spark/Kafka.
* Very strong understanding of best practices for Software Security.
* Strong understanding in cloud computing and experience in the major ones as AWS and Google Cloud.
* Considerable knowledge in currently landscape of Machine Learning concept, libraries, tools and overall workflow.
