== Recent projects:
- Quality Estimation API (https://api.taus.net), an application that accurately estimates the quality of machine translation output. The API is built using Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, PySpark, and PyTorch. The API is deployed on AWS EC2 GPU/cuda instances with Spring Cloud Gateway and Memached for caching. The API is deployed using Docker and GitHub Actions. Also, a full MLOps pipeline is in place for training and deploying new models, using PyTorch, Iterative/DVC/TPI, AWS S3/Lambdas. -- TAUS 2023
- Revamped the TAUS website (https://taus.net), replaced Joomla with using Nuxt.js v3, Tailwind CSS, and Storyblok CMS. Joomla is great and a nice CMS but we had just one person in the company who knew how to work with it, with the revamp we have a much more flexible and modern website that is straightforward to maintain and update by anyone in the company. The website is deployed on AWS ECS using Docker and GitHub Actions. This application also integrates with other microservices for authentication and authorization and user management. -- TAUS 2022
- TAUS Data Marketplace (https://datamarketplace.taus.net), a marketplace for language data. The marketplace is built using Java 17, Spring Boot/MVC/Security/Kafka/Data, JPA/Hibernate, QueryDSL, Jackson, Flyway, Gradle, AWS RDS MySQL. The marketplace is deployed on AWS ECS using Docker and GitHub Actions with OpenId Connect authorization.
-- TAUS 2022
- A serverless Data architecture for data processing and analytics. The architecture is built using Spring Camel, Apache Camel, QueryDSL/SQL, AWS Lambda/S3/Aurora/SNS/SQS/ECS, to AWS ECS using GitHub Actions. The data processing starts by uploading a file to S3 which triggers a lambda function that checks if there is enough AWS ECS Tasks available (rate limiting) to process the file, if not it triggers a new task otherwise forwards the message to a SQS queue which later will be consumed by the task. The task once completed sends a notifications to SNS where other components (ECS Tasks) will consume the message and process the data. Errors are sent to a SQS DLQ for further investigation.
-- TAUS 2021
- A machine learning pipeline to train and inference a model to predict the amount of baking articles that should be baked for one of Europe's biggest retail supermarket companies. The pipeline is built using Python, PySpark, Numpy, Pandas, Jinja, Apache Hadoop/pySpark, Hive and Spotify Luigi.
